websearch.py is for taking a picture, extracting text information and goes to search that text in the google scholar. use pytesseract (pip install pytesseract) which is the python extension of teserract OCR which has to be downloaded from online and saved it in program files folder in windows. ALso needs to add that folder path to the environment variables path. websearch.py assumes that there is only one photo in the operating folder and auto delete the taken photo after the running of the program.
